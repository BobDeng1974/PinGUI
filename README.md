# PinGUI

 Simple C++/SDL2/OpenGL created by Lubomir "Pinsius" Barantal
 

Some of its features are :
- Text creation (using SDL_TTF extension)
- Dynamic text handling(if you write a variable, library will automatically update the text if the variable changes)
- Basic gui elements (that can be networked together so elements can consist of other elements and create pure new style)
- Advanced window creation options
- Multitabbing (window can has more tabs with different content)
- Scrolling
- Windows have its own coordinate system ( [0;0] is the left corner of the window)
- Each tab can have its own settings (for example font)

This library was developed primary for learning purposes but now i consider it to be able
to handle also the GUI in my projects ( even if it still needs lot of improvements).

More info will be provided soon
